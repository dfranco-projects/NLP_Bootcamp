# NLP Bootcamp

Welcome to the **NLP Bootcamp** repository! This is an educational repo where I document key NLP concepts through hands-on exercises and Jupyter Notebook implementations. It explores the core building blocks of NLP as applied in real-world tasks such as text mining, machine learning, and language understanding.

This repository is **ideal for anyone looking to refine or fully grasp the core concepts of NLP**.

**To make setup easy, I've included a Docker container, so you can run everything in JupyterLab without worrying about dependencies.**

### 📘 Topics Covered

- **Text Data Manipulation**: I refined my ability to work with strings and text data in Python, which serves as the foundation for all NLP tasks.
  
- **Tokenization**: I learned advanced techniques for breaking down text into words, sentences, or documents, enabling deeper analysis of textual content.

- **Stemming and Lemmatization**: I deepened my understanding of reducing words to their root forms, an essential step for normalizing text data.

- **Text Classification**: I trained machine learning models to categorize text into predefined classes, improving my ability to apply NLP in real-world scenarios.

- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: I explored how to analyze the grammatical structure of sentences by identifying the parts of speech for each word, an important step for understanding the meaning and function of text.

- **Web Scraping for Text**: I enhanced my skills in extracting relevant text data from websites to use in various NLP applications.

- **Word Embeddings**: I delved into neural network techniques to convert words into numerical representations, using embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe for more powerful NLP applications.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: I built a sentiment classifier to analyze and determine the sentiment of text, a popular NLP task for customer feedback and opinion mining.

- **Sentence Representation as Tabular Data**: I learned how to represent sentences in a structured, tabular format, making it easier to work with machine learning models.
