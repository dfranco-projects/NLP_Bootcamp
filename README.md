# NLP Bootcamp

Welcome to the **NLP Bootcamp** repository! This is an educational repository where I document the concepts and code learned throughout the **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** course I completed on Udemy. With a background in data science and academic experience in text mining, this course allowed me to consolidate foundational NLP concepts and expand my understanding of advanced techniques, including both classical methods and modern approaches like Generative AI. 

This repository is intended for **anyone looking to refine or fully learn the foundational concepts of NLP**.

### Overview

Throughout this course, I deepened my knowledge of NLP by learning how to process and analyze text data with Python. NLP is a crucial field in data science, and this course provided both the theoretical grounding and practical exercises to further solidify my understanding of the concepts used in text mining, machine learning, and language processing.

### What I've Learned

- **Text Data Manipulation**: I refined my ability to work with strings and text data in Python, which serves as the foundation for all NLP tasks.
  
- **Tokenization**: I learned advanced techniques for breaking down text into words, sentences, or documents, enabling deeper analysis of textual content.

- **Stemming and Lemmatization**: I deepened my understanding of reducing words to their root forms, an essential step for normalizing text data.

- **Text Classification**: I trained machine learning models to categorize text into predefined classes, improving my ability to apply NLP in real-world scenarios.

- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: I explored how to analyze the grammatical structure of sentences by identifying the parts of speech for each word, an important step for understanding the meaning and function of text.

- **Web Scraping for Text**: I enhanced my skills in extracting relevant text data from websites to use in various NLP applications.

- **Word Embeddings**: I delved into neural network techniques to convert words into numerical representations, using embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe for more powerful NLP applications.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: I built a sentiment classifier to analyze and determine the sentiment of text, a popular NLP task for customer feedback and opinion mining.

- **Sentence Representation as Tabular Data**: I learned how to represent sentences in a structured, tabular format, making it easier to work with machine learning models.

### Skills I've Retained

- A deep understanding of core NLP concepts and techniques.
- Advanced ability to manipulate and process text data using Python.
- Expertise in tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization for text analysis.
- Strong practical experience in training machine learning models for text classification tasks.
- Proficiency in extracting and processing text data from websites through web scraping.
- Knowledge of advanced word embeddings techniques and their role in improving machine learning models.
- Experience in building sentiment classifiers and applying them to real-world datasets.
- In-depth understanding of how NLP techniques are applied in real-world NLP systems.

These skills have reinforced my understanding of NLP and set me up to explore more advanced topics in the field.
