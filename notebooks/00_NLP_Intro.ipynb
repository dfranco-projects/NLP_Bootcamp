    "This notebook focuses primarily on introducing key NLP concepts and theory.\n",

    "⚠️ **Warning: If you're already familiar with the main general concepts of NLP or prefer to jump straight into hands-on coding, feel free to skip ahead to [01_NLP_Tokenization.ipynb](01_NLP_Tokenization.ipynb) for the practical section.**\n",

    "### What is NLP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a subfield of computer science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) focused on enabling computers to interact with human language. Its **goal is to allow computers to understand, interpret, generate, and respond to human language** in meaningful and useful ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the rise of modern AI technologies, NLP has become **one of the fastest-growing and most impactful areas in AI**, driving innovations across many sectors.\n",

    "### What Are NLP's Applications?\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is used to **transform unstructured text from documents, conversations, or databases into structured data** for analysis or interaction. Some key applications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text mining and analytics\n",
    "- Text generation (e.g., ChatGPT)\n",
    "- Machine translation (e.g., Google Translate)\n",
    "- Chatbots and virtual assistants\n",
    "- Search engines and autocomplete\n",
    "- Text classification (e.g., Sentiment Analysis)\n",
    "- Voice recognition\n",
    "- And more...\n",

    "### The NLP Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The NLP pipeline involves several stages that process raw text data into meaningful information. At a high level, the pipeline consists of three main stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Corpus Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The first stage is collecting and preparing the corpus, which is a large collection of text used for training or testing. Corpus preparation includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Data Collection**: Gathering text data from diverse sources such as books, websites, or social media.\n",
    "    - **Text Cleaning**: Removing irrelevant elements like HTML tags or unnecessary symbols.\n",
    "    - **Text Preprocessing**: Steps such as tokenization, lowercasing, lemmatization, and removing stop words.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Feature engineering transforms raw text into numerical data that machine learning models can understand. Text is inherently unstructured, so this step includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Vectorization**: Converting text into numerical representations (e.g., bag-of-words, TF-IDF, word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe).\n",
    "    - **N-grams**: Using sequences of n consecutive words to capture context in a sentence.\n",
    "    - **Contextual Features**: Additional features such as sentence length, word frequency, part-of-speech tags, or named entity features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Task-Specific Modeling**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once the data has been prepared and features have been extracted, task-specific modeling is applied. This step uses machine learning or deep learning models to perform the NLP task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Heuristic Approach**: Simple rule-based methods used for tasks with limited data or early data collection.\n",
    "    - **Machine Learning Models**: Models like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), or Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are used for tasks like text classification or named entity recognition.\n",
    "    - **Deep Learning Models**: Advanced models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are used for tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and text summarization.\n",

    "The Challenges of NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite impressive progress, NLP still faces many challenges, mainly:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "1. **Ambiguity**: Natural language has ambiguous words and sentences can have multiple meanings depending on context.\n",
    "    - *Example:* \"He promised to give her dog food.\" -> Is he giving food for her dog, or dog food to her?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. **Language Variability**: The same idea can be expressed in many different ways, and NLP systems must recognize that they mean the same thing.\n",
    "    - *Example 1 (paraphrase):* \"The weather is nice today.\" vs. \"It's a beautiful day.\"\n",
    "    - *Example 2 (multiple expressions):* \"Turn off the lights.\" vs. \"Can you kill the lights?\"\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3. **Generalization**: NLP models are typically trained on a specific corpus. When used in a different domain, they may encounter unfamiliar words or sentence structures.\n",
    "    - This leads to issues with **Out-of-Domain (OOD)** data and **Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV)** words.\n",
    "    - *Example:* A chatbot trained on customer service emails might struggle with medical terminology or legal jargon.\n",
