# **NLP Introduction**

This guide **introduces the essential concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. If you're already familiar with the core principles and want to dive directly into practical implementation, feel free to skip ahead to `01_Corpus_Webscrap.ipynb`.

## What is NLP?

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a subfield of computer science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. The goal of NLP is to bridge the gap between human communication and machine comprehension, empowering machines to interact with text and speech in a meaningful way.

## Key Applications of NLP

NLP helps transform unstructured human language into structured data that machines can process. Some key applications include:

- **Text Mining and Analytics**
- **Text Generation** (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-3)
- **Machine Translation** (e.g., Google Translate)
- **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**
- **Search Engines and Autocomplete**
- **Text Classification** (e.g., sentiment analysis, spam detection)
- **Voice Recognition** (e.g., voice assistants like Siri, Alexa)

## The NLP Pipeline

The typical NLP workflow can be broken down into three core stages:

### 1. **Corpus Preparation**

> A **corpus** is a collection of text data used for training and testing NLP models.

Steps involved in corpus preparation include:

- **Data Collection**: Gathering text data from various sources (e.g., websites, APIs, documents).
- **Text Cleaning**: Removing HTML tags, punctuation, special characters, and unnecessary whitespace.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenizing text, converting to lowercase, removing stopwords, lemmatization, etc.

### 2. **Feature Engineering**

Feature engineering focuses on converting text data into a numerical form that can be used for machine learning or deep learning models. This includes:

- **Vectorization**: Converting text into numerical representations (e.g., Bag of Words, TF-IDF, word embeddings).
- **N-grams**: Extracting sequences of words to capture context.
- **Linguistic Features**: Identifying parts of speech, named entities, and syntactic structures.

### 3. **Task-Specific Modeling**

In this stage, NLP models are trained and fine-tuned to solve specific tasks. This can involve:

- **Rule-Based Systems**: Using if-else heuristics for simple tasks.
- **Classical Machine Learning**: Algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM for classification.
- **Deep Learning**: Leveraging advanced models like RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, GPT).

## Challenges in NLP

Despite rapid advancements, NLP still faces several challenges:

### 1. **Ambiguity**

Words and phrases often have multiple meanings depending on the context.

> *Example:* "He saw her duck." (Did she crouch? Or is it about a duck?)

### 2. **Language Variability**

The same idea can be expressed in various ways.

> *Example:* "Turn off the lights" vs. "Kill the lights."

### 3. **Generalization**

NLP models may struggle with generalization, especially when faced with **out-of-domain (OOD)** data or **out-of-vocabulary (OOV)** words.

> *Example:* A model trained on restaurant reviews may not understand medical terminology.
