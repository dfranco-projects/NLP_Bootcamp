# **NLP Introduction**

This guide **introduces the essential concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. If you're already familiar with the core principles and want to jump into practical implementation, you can skip ahead to `01_Corpus_Webscrap.ipynb`.

## What is NLP?

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a field within computer science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

Its main objective is to make human language accessible to machines for useful applications such as communication, automation, and information extraction.

## What Are NLP's Applications?

NLP is used to transform unstructured human language into structured data for computational use. Some key applications include:

* Text mining and analytics
* Text generation (e.g., ChatGPT)
* Machine translation (e.g., Google Translate)
* Chatbots and virtual assistants
* Search engines and autocomplete
* Text classification (e.g., sentiment analysis)
* Voice recognition

## The NLP Pipeline

The NLP workflow generally follows three core stages:

### 1. Corpus Preparation

> *Corpus*: A collection of text used for training/testing NLP models.

* **Data Collection**: Sourcing text data (e.g., websites, documents, APIs).
* **Text Cleaning**: Removing HTML tags, punctuation, special characters, etc.
* **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, lowercasing, lemmatization, and stopword removal.

### 2. Feature Engineering

* **Vectorization**: Converting text into numerical format (e.g., Bag of Words, TF-IDF, embeddings).
* **N-grams**: Capturing sequences of words for context.
* **Linguistic Features**: Part-of-speech tagging, named entities, etc.

### 3. Task-Specific Modeling

* **Rule-Based Systems**: If-else heuristics.
* **Classical ML**: Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.
* **Deep Learning**: RNN, LSTM, Transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT).

## Challenges of NLP

Despite its rapid progress, NLP still faces multiple challenges:

### 1. Ambiguity

Words and phrases often have multiple meanings.

> *Example:* "He saw her duck." (Did she crouch? Or does she have a duck?)

### 2. Language Variability

The same idea can be expressed in numerous ways.

> *Example:* "Turn off the lights" vs. "Kill the lights."

### 3. Generalization

Models may perform poorly on new domains due to **out-of-domain (OOD)** data or **out-of-vocabulary (OOV)** words.

> *Example:* A model trained on restaurant reviews may not understand medical records.
